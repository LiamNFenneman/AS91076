While the game is running, an obstacle be shown on the right side of the screen and will move towards the left side of the screen on a timer. The player has to jump (space bar) over each obstacle as it moves, if the player comes into contact with one of the obstacles the game will end and the score will be shown and high score will be updated if necessary. The aim of the game is to get as high of a score as possible. The score goes up every 100ms. The player doesnâ€™t move except for jumping.
